FINAL RESULTS:

/home/raphael/DOCFILES/DoctoralFiles/Juliet/C1.2/testcases/CWE134_Uncontrolled_Format_String/wtt/CWE134_Uncontrolled_Format_String__char_file_snprintf_15.c:288:  [3] (random) srand:
  This function is not sufficiently random for security-related functions
  such as key and nonce creation (CWE-327). Use a more secure technique for
  acquiring random values.
