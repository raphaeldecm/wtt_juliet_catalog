FINAL RESULTS:

/home/raphael/DOCFILES/DoctoralFiles/Juliet/C1.2/testcases/CWE190_Integer_Overflow/wtt/CWE190_Integer_Overflow__int_fgets_square_07.c:212:  [3] (random) srand:
  This function is not sufficiently random for security-related functions
  such as key and nonce creation (CWE-327). Use a more secure technique for
  acquiring random values.
/home/raphael/DOCFILES/DoctoralFiles/Juliet/C1.2/testcases/CWE190_Integer_Overflow/wtt/CWE190_Integer_Overflow__int_fgets_square_07.c:39:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
/home/raphael/DOCFILES/DoctoralFiles/Juliet/C1.2/testcases/CWE190_Integer_Overflow/wtt/CWE190_Integer_Overflow__int_fgets_square_07.c:44:  [2] (integer) atoi:
  Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range
  (CWE-190). If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the
  input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number;
  consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended).
