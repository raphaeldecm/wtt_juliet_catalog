FINAL RESULTS:

/home/raphael/DOCFILES/DoctoralFiles/Juliet/C1.2/testcases/CWE190_Integer_Overflow/wtt/CWE190_Integer_Overflow__int_fgets_square_09.c:207:  [3] (random) srand:
  This function is not sufficiently random for security-related functions
  such as key and nonce creation (CWE-327). Use a more secure technique for
  acquiring random values.
