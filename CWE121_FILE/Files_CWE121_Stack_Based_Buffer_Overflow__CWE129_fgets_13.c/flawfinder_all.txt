FINAL RESULTS:

/home/raphael/DOCFILES/DoctoralFiles/Juliet/C1.2/testcases/CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow/wtt/CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_fgets_13.c:265:  [3] (random) srand:
  This function is not sufficiently random for security-related functions
  such as key and nonce creation (CWE-327). Use a more secure technique for
  acquiring random values.

  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.

  Unless checked, the resulting number can exceed the expected range
  (CWE-190). If source untrusted, check both minimum and maximum, even if the
  input had no minus sign (large numbers can roll over into negative number;
  consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended).
